 When you first load this mod, a config file will appear on the Mod's folder, which you should edit to your liking. 

 This mod edition has three Conditions with different values, which are:


	- CONDITION: TownMap
		VALUES: TownRuins, TownPlaza

	- CONDITION: StringsEdits
		VALUES: true, false
		
	- CONDITION: TownFestivals
		VALUES: true, false

		
 * The first condition - TownMap - relates to which Town map you'll be using.

	1. "TownRuins" 
		For those who would like to have the Joja ruins in their Town map; it will automatically change from the Joja map to the TownRuins map once you've finished the Community Centre quest.
		- This is the default.
	
	2. "TownPlaza" 
		For those who, instead of having the Joja Ruins in their Town, prefer having a new Plaza area. 
		- Only use this after you've finished with the Community Centre Quest!
	
		
 * The second condition - StringsEdits - are to be used by those who do not intend to use my NPC map edits. 
	By default, this is set to true. If you don't want to play with my NPC map edits, set this to false.
	
	
 * The third condition - TownFestivals - follows the same idea has the previous condition: it is to be used by those who may not be interested in my Town Festival edits.
	By default, this is set to true. If you do not want to play with my Town Festival maps, set this to false.



			===== DO NOT FORGET =====
			
			You need Entoarox Framework to reset the bushes - if you aren't playing with a new save!
			Load your save file and type in the SMAPI console:
						world_bushreset
			And you will see the bushes in their new place!

	* Stardew Valley Enhanced, credited to FlashShifter (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3596)

	* Elliott's House Tilesheet were originally made by Bartalac, and shared through their Mod - Elliott's cozy shack. 
I changed some things and added others to my liking. I tried talking with Bartalac and request adding their work to mine, but unfortunately they haven't visit the ChuckleFish Forums since April 6, 2016. I will be making this adjustment and crediting the original author, but if they ever return and are against me adding this to my Mod, it will be removed.

	* The Hot Springs Tilesheet added to the Town map were originally done by DevilBro's Hot Spring behind Joja Market. 
I changed it according to my liking. Much like what happened with Bartalac, DevilBro hasn't been online in a while, and even though I did message them, I got no response. Therefore, I will be taking the same stance as per Bartalac's case, and use this as I see fit, but if I'm ever contacted by the original author and they are not happy with my use of their resources, it will be removed.
